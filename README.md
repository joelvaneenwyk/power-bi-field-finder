# Power BI Field Finder

Use the `Power BI Field Finder` to understand where in your reports your columns and measures are being used and find the ones that aren't being used at all.  Be careful before deleting columns and measures, especially if your model is being used in the service by other reports! Update: to analyze multiple reports and the associated dataset, use the new Field Finder (with data model) files!

Disclaimer:  This is a side project and is not perfect.  Please let me know if you run into any errors with it.

## Instructions

1. Open the `Power BI Field Finder.pbit` file and you will be prompted to enter parameters for the folder where your reports are, the database server, and the database name.
2. Click the Load button, and find your fields on the following pages!
3. When you make changes to your reports, save them and refresh the `Power BI Field Finder`.  If you'd like to analyze different reports or datasets, update the parameters.

## Sample File

The `pbix` used in the original sample is based on the [Power BI Desktop August 2019 update](https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples/tree/master/Monthly%20Desktop%20Blog%20Samples/2019).

For the new version with multiple reports and a shared dataset, see the `AdventureWorks` and `Sales Report` files.
